# Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„  

Welcome to my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), an annual coding challenge that takes place in December. This repository contains my personal approach to each puzzle, with solutions implemented in C#.

## About Advent of Code  
Advent of Code is a series of daily programming puzzles released from December 1st to December 25th. It's a fun way to practice problem-solving skills, learn new programming concepts, or just enjoy coding during the holiday season.

## Structure of the Repository  
Each day's challenge has it's own problem, input and solution file.
